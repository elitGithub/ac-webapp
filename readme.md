# Prerequisites

- [NodeJS LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

# Quick Start

Clone the repo:

```
git clone
```

Install dependencies:

```
cd ac-webapp
yarn
```

Run the dev server:

```
yarn dev
```

This process will run a dev server that makes the webapp accessible from your
browser - likely through http://localhost:5173/, but the port may change if
the default is inaccessible. Either way, after running `yarn dev`, it will
display the link you should use.

The dev server has hot reloading capabilities, which means it will auto refresh
when you make changes to the code.
